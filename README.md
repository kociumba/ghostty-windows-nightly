# DISCLAIMER: This is not an official distribution of Ghostty and is in no way affiliated with the Ghostty project.

This is a simple GitHub Action set up to build Ghostty for Windows every day at UTC+0000.
These builds are then published as releases in this repository.

This is done as Ghostty does not provide windows releases yet.

If you want to use these builds, please keep in mind that they are always taken from the main branch, and there is no guarantee these builds will work.

Any bugs encountered should be reported to the official [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) repository, as this repository does not modify any of the source code.
